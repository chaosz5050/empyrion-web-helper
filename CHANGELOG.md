## [0.6.1] - 2025-08-06

### Security
- **Critical Security Fixes** - Addressed multiple security vulnerabilities identified in security audit
  - **SQL Injection Prevention** - Added column name whitelist validation for database filter queries
  - **Input Validation Enhancement** - Added 500 character limit for message inputs to prevent abuse
  - **Directory Traversal Protection** - Fixed static file serving to prevent access to sensitive files
- **Enhanced Security Posture** - Proactive security hardening for safer hobby project deployment
  - Database queries now validate allowed column names before execution
  - Message inputs properly validated and length-limited
  - Static file serving restricted to proper directory scope

### Fixed  
- **Security Vulnerabilities** - Three critical issues resolved:
  - SQL injection via unvalidated column names in player filters
  - Directory traversal via unrestricted static file serving  
  - Insufficient input validation on message endpoints

### Technical Details
- **Database Security** - Filter queries now use allowed column whitelist: `steam_id`, `name`, `status`, `faction`, `ip_address`, `country`, `playfield`
- **Input Validation** - Message endpoints validate content length and reject empty/oversized inputs
- **Static File Security** - File serving restricted to `static/` directory, preventing access to sensitive project files

### Developer Notes
- Security fixes maintain full backward compatibility with existing functionality
- No changes to user interface or API behavior
- Recommended update for all deployments, especially public-facing instances
