## [0.5.4] - 2025-07-26

### Fixed
- **Critical Message Duplication Bug** - Fixed scheduled and welcome/goodbye messages being logged as "sent" even when they failed
  - **Root Cause**: Background service incorrectly evaluated return values from `send_global_message()`
  - **Issue**: Method returns `{'success': False, 'message': 'error'}` but code checked `if success:` instead of `if success['success']`
  - **Impact**: Non-empty dictionaries always evaluate to `True`, causing failed messages to be marked as sent
  - **Solution**: Changed to `result.get('success', False)` for proper boolean evaluation
  - **Files Modified**: 
    - `background_service.py` lines 769-777 (scheduled messages)
    - `background_service.py` lines 717-727 (welcome/goodbye messages)
- **Enhanced Error Reporting** - Failed messages now properly log error details instead of false success messages
- **Improved Message Debugging** - Added comprehensive debug logging to trace message sending pipeline

### Technical Details
- The "duplication" was actually false positive logging - messages appeared to send twice but were failing silently
- Fix ensures only genuinely successful messages are recorded as sent
- Enhanced error handling provides better visibility into messaging failures
- Debug logging helps identify future messaging issues

## [0.5.3] - 2025-01-25

### Added
- **Complete CSS Optimization & Theming System** - Revolutionary 3-phase implementation
  - **Phase 1**: Modular CSS architecture - Split 1,980-line monolithic CSS into 6 logical modules

    - 3-tier border radius system (`--radius-sm/md/lg`)
    - Interactive state variables (`--hover-overlay`, `--focus-ring`, etc.)
    - Base component classes (`.btn-base`, `.form-base`, `.panel-base`)
  - **Phase 3**: Multi-theme support with real-time switching
    - üåô **Dark Theme** (default) - High contrast, reduced eye strain
